    <p style="border: 5px solid black;">A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and
        diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required
        to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages. It also captures the structure in which these
        methods are to be undertaken.

        In other words, a life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its
        inception to retirement. Different life cycle models may plan the necessary development activities to phases in
        different ways. Thus, no element which life cycle model is followed, the essential activities are contained in
        all life cycle models though the action may be carried out in distinct orders in different life cycle models.
        During any life cycle stage, more than one activity may also be carried out.</p>
